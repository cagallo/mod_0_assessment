Pt 2: Program Specific Challenge

2. var animal = "Dog";

3. var isCuddly = true;

4. animal = "Cat";

5. var num8 = 21;

6. var num3 = 7;

7. var quotient = num8/num3; //type quotient into the console (no var),press enter to get the answer= 3

8. var favoriteFilms = ["The Godfather", "Clueless", "Rear Window"];

9. favoriteFilms.shift(); // type favoriteFilms into the console to see the first element removed from array

10. animal.length; //enter and number of characters in string will be returned

//for questions 9 and 10 I was able to get the answer with and without the semi-colon, I added it to be safe :)
